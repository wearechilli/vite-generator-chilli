# Chilli starter project for Craft CMS

A starter project based on nitro, craft cms & vite.js

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup
Setup your nitro container based upon this boilerplate. Make sure to use **PHP 7.4** to use **webp** images. This is because Imagick has not yet been updated to work with PHP 8.

    nitro create wearechilli/vite-generator-chilli your-site-folder

Install craft:

    nitro craft install/craft

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Vite

You must start Vite from within your container, to start vite run:

    nitro ssh
    npm run dev

One issue currently in Vite is when referencing assets processed in Vite such as images in CSS, [click here](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/issues/2196) for more info. A workaround is to set the base url when Vite dev server is running. In `templates/_layout/base.twig` see:

    <base href="{{ alias('@viteBaseUrl') }}">

Because of this you  must use absolute url's in your app everywhere.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Deploying

Deploying is done though Combell AutoGit. Make sure AutoGit is enabled in the project's service pack. Add the combell remote branch.

    git remote add combell domainbe@ssh.domain.be:auto.git

Push to your remote to deploy the current branch.

    git push combell

## üóÑ Syncing database & assets

Inside `./scripts` you can find a set of bash scripts to sync databases and assets between local and remote. Fill in `SSH_REMOTE_USER` and `SSH_REMOTE_HOST` in your `.env` file and run the scripts via npm `npm run <task> <branch>`:

    npm run db:pull master
    npm run db:push staging
    npm run assets:pull my-custom-branch
    npm run assets:push master

## ü§ì Code Examples

Make sure to check the `templates/examples.twig` file for frontend things that are included in the boilerplate such as: SVG's, image transforms, modals, menu overlays, form elements, etc.

## üí∞ Commerce

Install commerce plugin (make sure to upgrade to **pro** version) and import `./commerce.json` with architect plugin. Most of pre built commerce templates are in `templates/_commerce`.

+ Install Mollie plugin (payment gateway), Style Inliner (commerce emails) and optionally Snaptcha (spam)
+ Create a product type called 'Catalog' and make sure it has **multiple variants**
+ Attach the field `shopCategory` to the 'Product Fields' tab
+ Attach the field `uniqueCombinationOfVariantAttributes` to the 'Variant Fields' tab
+ Create an order field tab called 'Extra Gegevens' and add the following fields:
    - `pickupLocation`
    - `pickupDate`
    - `pickupTime`
    - `orderNotes`
+ Depending on your project, add a PDF template and email template (email templates are provided in `_commerce/emails/order`)
+ Change payment currency to EUR
+ Set up a tax zone for Belgium, tax categories (one each for 21%, 6% and 0%) & according tax rates. The tax rates should all be 'already included in the taxable subject' and not applied with a valid VAT ID.
+ Create 3 shipping categories:
    - `general` for shippable products
    - `pickup` for products that can only be picked up at the store
    - `letters` for things that fit in envelopes (like gift cards)
+ Create 3 shipping methods to match the 3 categories (look for similar sites for examples)

## üèÉ A word about the Craft Queue & Combell

Craft executes all kind of tasks via a queue system. Jobs (aka tasks) are added to the queue, and get executed. Unfortunately this queue only starts when someone logs into the control panel.

The queue can also be started through the craft executable. Since Combell does not allow plugins to start php processes, we have to do this via cron:

    sss user@xxx.webhosting.be
    nano /etc/crontab

Create a cron job that executes the queue every 5 minutes like so:

    */5 * * * * /usr/bin/env php checkout/master/current/craft queue/run
